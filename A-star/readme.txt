1.) Compile the code using command: javac astar.java
2.) Run the code using command:  java astar < testcase.txt

HOW TO GIVE INPUT:
1.) The input should be given in string format like shown in the example below:
1 5 6
4 2 3
B 7 8
should be given as : 156423078

2.) Similarly goal state should be given in  the same way.
3.) Heuristic type should be given in Integer number as 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 which corresponds to the ques number in the assignment.

Note: The optimal path is shown in the form of swapping. EX: <1,5> means swap element at pos 1 (base index 1) to element at index 5 of the string in the current configuration.
